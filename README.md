<ul>
<li>Our culture being centered around the prominence of water being manifested in many forms. 
Our project is yet another step in conservation and preservation of the water bodies.</li>

<li>Due to rapid urbanization and increase in population, water resources are exploited.
Not only depleting in the attempt of acquisition also contaminating while doing so.
One of the ways of the quality being degraded is <b>"Eutrophication"</b>.</li>

<li>Where a water body develops a surplus amount of nutrients and phosphorus from pollutants allowing for te rapid growth of algae and plankton.  
It takes minimum of a year to regain the old nature of the lake </li>
<li>Though the eutrophication caused by enteromopha prolifera does not affect humans or animals 
directly, due to oxygen meant for aquatic life forms being consumed, the ecosystem is disturbed </li>
  </ul>

</picture> Problem Statement :</h2></div>
<ul>
<li>Because of Eutropication, The ecosystem which is an extension of our environment remains unbalanced, and will affect the life forms that depend on it directly or indirectly.</li>
<li>The fishermen whose livelyhood depends on the water body can't meet their demands with the drastically reduced 
breeding of aquatic life forms</li>
<li>Farmers who utilize the river water for irrigation can't use it anymore due to its contamination or overnourishment of nutrients which leaves the crops with stunted growth.
</li>
  </ul>

</picture> Problem Solution :</h2></div>
<ul>
<li> Hence, a web application using Node-RED is developed which facilitates the monitoring and conservation of water bodies with the aid of sensors responsible for measuring the pH, turbidity, and other factors of the source.</li>
<li>The data obtained will be updating in Real Time to the IBM cloud platform through means of IoT. The Web UI is made in such a way that  the data can be viewed in an organised way after its retrival from the periodically.</li>
<li>An initmation will be given to the user upon crossing over the thresholds of the parameters being monitored.</li>
<li>Furthermore, it is also equipped with a mobile application which control hardware and similar operation with ease.
 </li>
  </ul>
